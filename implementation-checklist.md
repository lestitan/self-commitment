## Notes
- The migration date (20250226152557) appears to be set to a future date (February 2025). This might need to be reviewed.
- Need to install these packages for the new functionality:
  ```
  npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
  ```
- You need to add your Stripe API keys to the environment variables:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key for server-side operations
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Stripe publishable key for client-side
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Secret for validating webhook events
- For testing components with form validation, make sure to:
  - Add `role="form"` to forms to aid in test selection
  - Use `fireEvent.input` instead of `fireEvent.change` for proper input handling
  - Use `waitFor` to handle async validation properly
- Common testing patterns established:
  - Component testing pattern with rendering tests and interaction tests
  - Mock implementations for external dependencies like Clerk and Stripe
  - API testing utilities for simulating Next.js API routes
  - Service testing with mocked database and external services

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
